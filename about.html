<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 17px;">My Story</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I started programming in 2014-2015 on a <a href="https://raspi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_31931.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 1B</a>. I played Minecraft on it even though it was just the Raspberry Pi version (which sucked). It made me learn more about computers by breaking a lot of the time. It also had Linux on it, and it was my first computer, so I wasn&apos;t complaining. I started programming with Bash, or the Bourne Again Shell. It is by far the easiest programming language because it doesn&apos;t have any libraries (good and bad). It allows you to run system commands like cp, sed, grep, rm and more. If you want &nbsp;to view the manpages (manual pages), run man &lt;command&gt; to view it&apos;s page. Bash gives the power to the user by using system commands, which I had been using for a while so I had known about commands so it was fairly easy to get started. I just created trivial programs like one where it asks your name and it says: &apos;hi, &lt;name&gt;&apos;.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>printf &quot;What is your name: &quot;</p>
    <p>read -r name</p>
    <p>echo &quot;hi $name&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is simple and you can run it from the shell. But you could put it into a bash script by creating a file with the suffix .sh and adding #!/bin/bash to the top of the file followed by your script. You would run it by typing ./script.sh in the terminal. That was my first experience coding. I also dabbled with python, trying to recreate the ask for name, say hi name but in python2. I used <a href="http://www.cs.unca.edu/~bruce/Fall14/360/RPiUsersGuide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this book</a> if you want to know. I did something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>userName = raw_input(&ldquo;What is your name? &ldquo;)</p>
    <p>print &ldquo;Welcome to the program,&rdquo;, userName</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mind you, this was python2, not 3 and raw_input is a terrible way to ask for input because you could inject your own code but I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. I didn&apos;t do much python till 2020-2021 as I feel more comfortable with Bash. To this day, Bash is my go to for programming. I&apos;ve even created a <a href="https://github.com/Henryws/pacstall">package manager in Bash</a>--the only other package manager written in bash is Portage (for Gentoo), and that is some complex shiz.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t really remember much from the journey but I&apos;m here now and as of April 2021, I have gotten so far since 2014.</p>
